# Data-Visualization-Lab-3
This is my submission for lab assignment in data visualization. <br>
In this lab, I learnt to create multiple plots, related to map data(mainly polygons). I have also tried multiple interactive plots using libraries like geopandas, cartopy etc. <br>
I have also added legends in the bubble maps, to make the graph more meaningful <br>
Below is an example such graphs: <br>
